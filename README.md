# smartCalculator
Nothing special here, I just don't have clear code ideas yet, that's why I just made instead some mathematical tools which can be accessed by using this program, this is almost like a full two weeks of everything I've learned, used in one single code which now was developed into a smart calculator toolkit program (if it makes some sense).
